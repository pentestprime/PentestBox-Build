# PentestBox
This repository contains tools to create a 2GB SD card image based upon latest arch sources including all dependencies 
for PentestBox. PentestBox is a fork of the Piratebox project, intended for use by penetration testers and designed for 
security.

# Build the Image
Run ./build.sh.  The build script will ask some simple questions.  It will then install required dependencies and build the PentestBox image automagically.  

# Credits
Thanks to the PirateBox developers for developing PirateBox.
